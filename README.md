# Fishwave keyboard.
This is WIP!
The fishwave Keyboard is a split ergonomic Keyboard with a dactyl like shape and ortholinear key arrangement. It is entirely 3d printed and hand wired. The layout is simmilar to the Corne Keyboard, 42 Key. 
For now its just the stl files. When my exams are over, i will add build instructions etc.
