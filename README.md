# What is this?
- One of the cheapest split dactyl keyboards (Can be built for under 50 Euros.)
- For the people that want a dacty layout, without having 2 brick sized keyboards on their desk.
- Dactyl keyboards dont have to be huge in size! This keyboard is a perfect compromize in compactness and ergonomics.

This is WIP, but the first beta (1.2) is perfectly printable, and im currently using it, and i will continue improving the design!


The fishwave Keyboard is a split ergonomic Keyboard with a dactyl like shape and ortholinear key arrangement. It is entirely 3d printed and hand wired. The layout is simmilar to the Corne Keyboard, 42 Key. 
For now its just the stl files. When my exams are over, i will add build instructions etc.
